Astronomy projects with big data

Most of the contents of this repository is the result of exercises from [Data-driven Astroomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). All of the data and some of the code was provided as part of the course.

The intent is to use this repository for further big data explorations in astronomy focused on applying machine learning algorithms and techniques to searching for and understanding exoplanets.
